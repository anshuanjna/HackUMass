# TabSense

An intelligent browser extension that automatically organizes your open tabs into logical groups using Google's Gemini AI.

## Overview

TabSense helps you declutter your browser by analyzing your open tabs and intelligently sorting them into organized groups. Whether you're researching, working on multiple projects, or just have too many tabs open, TabSense uses AI to understand the context and purpose of each tab to create meaningful groupings.
